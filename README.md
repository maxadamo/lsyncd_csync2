## Description

This module sets up directory synchronization across a number of nodes.
It is a condensed version of thias and scottsb modules, less convolutend
and with less dependencies.

## Setup

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section
here.

### Beginning with lsyncd_csync2

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most
basic use of the module.

## Usage

This section is where you describe how to customize, configure, and do the
fancy stuff with your module here. It's especially helpful if you include usage
examples and code samples for doing things with your module.

## Reference

Users need a complete list of your module's classes, types, defined types providers, facts, and functions, along with the parameters for each. You can provide this list either via Puppet Strings code comments or as a complete list in this Reference section.

* If you are using Puppet Strings code comments, this Reference section should include Strings information so that your users know how to access your documentation.

* If you are not using Puppet Strings, include a list of all of your classes, defined types, and so on, along with their parameters. Each element in this listing should include:

  * The data type, if applicable.
  * A description of what the element does.
  * Valid values, if the data type doesn't make it obvious.
  * Default value, if any.

## Limitations

This is where you list OS compatibility, version compatibility, etc. If there
are Known Issues, you might want to include them under their own heading here.

## Development

Since your module is awesome, other users will want to play with it. Let them
know what the ground rules for contributing are.

## Release Notes/Contributors/Etc. **Optional**

If you aren't using changelog, put your release notes here (though you should
consider using changelog). You can also add any additional sections you feel
are necessary or important to include here. Please use the `## ` header.
